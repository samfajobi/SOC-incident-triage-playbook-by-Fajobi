# SOC Alert Triage Playbooks (SOC Analyst Focus)

Welcome to my **SOC Alert Triage Playbooks** repository!  
This repository is designed to document **how I approach alert triage as a SOC analyst**, focusing on decision-making, investigation workflows, and escalation criteria. The emphasis is **process-first**, tool-agnostic, and reflects real-world SOC thinking.

## 🚀 Purpose of this Repository

In real SOC environments, tools are only as effective as the analyst interpreting them.  
This repo is intended to demonstrate:

- **Structured alert triage workflows** for common SOC scenarios  
- **True positive vs false positive indicators**  
- **Evidence validation and investigation steps**  
- **Escalation criteria for L2/L3 analysts**  
- **Tool-agnostic thinking** that mirrors real-world SOC operations

By practicing these workflows, SOC analysts can develop critical skills in **alert validation, incident assessment, and decision-making**, independent of the tools being used.
