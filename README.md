# SOC Alert Triage Playbooks (SOC Analyst Focus)

Welcome to my **SOC Alert Triage Playbooks** repository!  
This repository is designed to document **how I approach alert triage as a SOC analyst**, focusing on decision-making, investigation workflows, and escalation criteria. The emphasis is **process-first**, tool-agnostic, and reflects real-world SOC thinking.

## 🚀 Purpose of this Repository

In real SOC environments, tools are only as effective as the analyst interpreting them.  
This repo is intended to demonstrate:

- **Structured alert triage workflows** for common SOC scenarios  
- **True positive vs false positive indicators**  
- **Evidence validation and investigation steps**  
- **Escalation criteria for L2/L3 analysts**  
- **Tool-agnostic thinking** that mirrors real-world SOC operations

## 🚀 Biggest Lessons

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned while building my SOC lab is that tools matter less than knowing what to do with an alert.

As a SOC Level 1 analyst, the real skill is triage:
- **Understanding what an alert actually mean**
- **Determining if it’s benign or suspicious**
- **Validating evidence across logs**
- **Deciding whether to escalate, contain, or close**

In my lab, I now focus on process-first learning:
- **Triage alerts before opening tools**
- **Define true vs false positive indicators**
- **Practice escalation decisions**
- **Document investigation steps clearly**

Once the process is clear, the tools simply support the decision.

This mindset has changed how I approach SOC tools like SIEMs, IDS/IPS, and SOAR — and it’s helping me build skills that translate to real-world SOC environments.

By practicing these workflows, SOC analysts can develop critical skills in **alert validation, incident assessment, and decision-making**, independent of the tools being used.


## MITRE ATT&CK Alignment

Each playbook includes relevant MITRE ATT&CK mappings to provide
threat context and explain where the alert fits within the attack lifecycle.
This helps guide triage decisions and escalation priorities.
