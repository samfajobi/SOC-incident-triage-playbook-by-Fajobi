When we **map an attack to MITRE ATT&CK**, we are mapping **what the attacker did** (their **actions and behaviors**) to **standardized techniques and tactics** in the ATT&CK framework.

We are **NOT** mapping:

* Tools
* Malware names
* CVE numbers
* IP addresses

We are mapping **attacker behavior**.

---

## What exactly are we mapping?

We map **observed attack activities** to:

### 1️⃣ **Tactics** (the *WHY*)

The attacker’s **goal at that stage** of the attack.

Examples:

* Initial Access
* Execution
* Persistence
* Privilege Escalation
* Defense Evasion
* Credential Access
* Command and Control
